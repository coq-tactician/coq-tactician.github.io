  <meta property="og:description" content="Graph2Tac: Learning Hierarchical Representations of Math Concepts in Theorem Proving
Abstract: Concepts abound in mathematics and its applications. They vary greatly between subject areas, and new ones are introduced in each mathematical paper or application. A formal theory builds a hierarchy of definitions, theorems and proofs that reference each other. When an AI agent is proving a new theorem, most of the mathematical concepts and lemmas relevant to that theorem may have never been seen during training. This is especially true in the Coq proof assistant, which has a diverse library of Coq projects, each with its own definitions, lemmas, and even custom tactic procedures used to prove those lemmas. It is essential for agents to incorporate such new information into their knowledge base on the fly. We work towards this goal by utilizing a new, large-scale, graph-based dataset for machine learning in Coq. We leverage a faithful graph-representation of Coq terms that induces a directed graph of dependencies between definitions to create a novel graph neural network, Graph2Tac (G2T), that takes into account not only the current goal, but also the entire hierarchy of definitions that led to the current goal. G2T is an online model that is deeply integrated into the users’ workflow and can adapt in real time to new Coq projects and their definitions. It complements well with other online models that learn in real time from new proof scripts. Our novel definition embedding task, which is trained to compute representations of mathematical concepts not seen during training, boosts the performance of the neural network to rival state-of-the-art k-nearest neighbor predictors.">

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> The notion of α-equivalence between λ-terms is commonly used to
identify terms that are considered equal. However, due to the primitive
treatment of free variables, this notion falls short when comparing subterms
occurring within a larger context. Depending on the usage of the Barendregt
convention (choosing different variable names for all involved binders), it
will equate either too few or too many subterms. We introduce a formal notion
of context-sensitive α-equivalence, where two open terms can be compared
within a context that resolves their free variables. We show that this
equivalence coincides exactly with the notion of bisimulation equivalence.
Furthermore, we present an efficient O(n log n) runtime algorithm that
identifies λ-terms modulo context-sensitive α-equivalence, improving upon a
previously established O(n log^2 n) bound for a hashing modulo ordinary
α-equivalence by Maziarz et al. Hashing λ-terms is useful in many applications
that require common subterm elimination and structure sharing. We employ the
algorithm to obtain a large-scale, densely packed, interconnected graph of
mathematical knowledge from the Coq proof assistant for machine learning
purposes.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> The Tactician&rsquo;s Web is a platform offering a large web of
strongly interconnected, machine-checked, formal mathematical knowledge
conveniently packaged for machine learning, analytics, and proof engineering.
Built on top of the Coq proof assistant, the platform exports a dataset
containing a wide variety of formal theories, presented as a web of
definitions, theorems, proof terms, tactics, and proof states. Theories are
encoded both as a semantic graph (rendered below) and as human-readable text,
each with a unique set of advantages and disadvantages. Proving agents may
interact with Coq through the same rich data representation and can be
automatically benchmarked on a set of theorems. Tight integration with Coq
provides the unique possibility to make agents available to proof engineers as
practical tools.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> We present a comparison of several online machine learning
techniques for tactical learning and proving in the Coq proof assistant. This
work builds on top of Tactician, a plugin for Coq that learns from proofs
written by the user to synthesize new proofs. Learning happens in an online
manner, meaning that Tactician’s machine learning model is updated immediately
every time the user performs a step in an interactive proof. This has
important advantages compared to the more studied offline learning systems:
(1) it provides the user with a seamless, interactive experience with
Tactician and, (2) it takes advantage of locality of proof similarity, which
means that proofs similar to the current proof are likely to be found close
by. We implement two online methods, namely approximate k-nearest neighbors
based on locality sensitive hashing forests and random decision forests.
Additionally, we conduct experiments with gradient boosted trees in an offline
setting using XGBoost. We compare the relative performance of Tactician using
these three learning methods on Coq’s standard library.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> An extended version of this paper is available <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.00120">on arXiv</a></p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> We present Tactician, a tactic learner and prover for the
Coq Proof Assistant. Tactician helps users make tactical proof decisions
while they retain control over the general proof strategy. To this end,
Tactician learns from previously written tactic scripts and gives users
either suggestions about the next tactic to be executed or altogether
takes over the burden of proof synthesis. Tactician’s goal is to provide
users with a seamless, interactive, and intuitive experience together with
robust and adaptive proof automation.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> We present a system that utilizes machine learning for tactic
proof search in the Coq Proof Assistant. In a similar vein as the TacticToe
project for HOL4, our system predicts appropriate tactics and finds proofs in
the form of tactic scripts. To do this, it learns from previous tactic scripts
and how they are applied to proof states. The performance of the system is
evaluated on the Coq Standard Library. Currently, our predictor can identify
the correct tactic to be applied to a proof state 23.4% of the time. Our proof
searcher can fully automatically prove 39.3% of the lemmas. When combined with
the CoqHammer system, the two systems together prove 56.7% of the library’s
lemmas.</p>
