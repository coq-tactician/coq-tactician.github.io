          <h1>An online demo of Tactician</h1>
          <h2><a href="http://coq-tactician.github.io">Back to Tactician's website</a></h2>
        <p>
            Below, we provide a toy example for how you can use Tactician in your development.
            This page is a fully-fledged version of Coq, based on jsCoq. You can interactively navigate
            through this document using either the green buttons on the top right of the page, or using the
            shortcuts Alt+Down and Alt+Up.
        </p>
        <p>
            This demo is based on lists of natural numbers. These <code>lists</code> are inductively
            defined with the constructors <code>nil</code> for the empty list and <code>cons</code> for adding
            a number to an existing list.
        </p>
<textarea id="coq-code1">
Inductive list :=
| nil  : list
| cons : nat → list → list.</textarea>
<p>
    With these lists we define the notations <code>[]</code> for the empty list and <code>n :: ls</code> to
    append the number <code>n</code> to the list <code>ls</code>.
</p>
<textarea id="coq-code2">
Notation "[]" := nil.
Notation "n :: ls" := (cons n ls).</textarea>
<p>
    We are going to prove things about the concatenation operation on lists. Concatenation is defined below
    as the function <code>concat</code> with the notation <code>ls₁ ++ ls₂</code> representing the
    concatenation of the lists <code>ls₁</code> and <code>ls₂</code>.
</p>
<textarea id="coq-code3">
Fixpoint concat ls₁ ls₂ :=
  match ls₁ with
  | []      => ls₂
  | x::ls₁' => x::(concat ls₁' ls₂)
  end where "ls₁ ++ ls₂" := (concat ls₁ ls₂).</textarea>
<p>
The first thing we whish to prove is that the empty list <code>[]</code> is the right identity of concatenation:
</p>
<textarea id="coq-code4">
Lemma concat_nil_r : forall ls, ls ++ [] = ls.
Proof.</textarea>
<p>
Now we need to prove this lemma, as can be seen with in the goal on the right panel. This is where Tactician's
automation comes in. The two main commands that Tactician provides are <code>Suggest</code> and
<code>search</code>. You can try <code>Suggest</code> now, but because we have not proven anything yet Tactician
has not learnt any tactics yet and is unable to suggest anything:
</p>
<textarea id="coq-code5">
Suggest.</textarea>
<p>
    Therefore, we will have to manually prove this lemma to give Tactician something to learn from:
</p>
<textarea id="coq-code6">
intros.
induction ls.
- simpl. reflexivity.
- simpl. f_equal. apply IHls.
Qed.</textarea>
<p>
The system has immediately learnt from this lemma. (It was even learning during the proof of the lemma,
you can see this by inserting <code>Suggest</code> in different places in the proof above.)
Tactician is now ready to help you prove the next lemma, namely the associativity of list concatenation.
</p>
<textarea id="coq-code7">
Lemma concat_assoc : forall ls ls₂ ls₃, (ls ++ ls₂) ++ ls₃ = ls ++ (ls₂ ++ ls₃).
Proof.</textarea>
<p>
We can again ask for suggestions, and this time Tactician is able to give some answers:
<textarea id="coq-code8">
Suggest.</textarea>
<p>
    If you wish, you can follow some of the suggestions by copying them into the editor. You can then
    repeatedly ask for more suggestions. Sometimes they will be good and sometimes not. Alternatively,
    you can also ask Tactician to search for a complete proof:
</p>
<textarea id="coq-code9">
search.</textarea>
<p>
    Tactician now immediately solves the goal. Notice that it has also printed a caching tactic in the right
    bottom panel. You can copy this tactic and replace the original <code>search</code> tactic above with it.
    Now, when you re-prove this lemma, Tactician will first try to prove it using the cache, only resorting
    to proof search if the cache fails (this can happen when you change definitions the lemma relies on).
</p>

<h2>A more advanced example</h2>
<p>
    In this example, we show how you can teach Tactician about user-defined, domain-specific tactics.
    This is very useful as it allows you to teach Tactician the "tricks of the trade". We start with
    an inductive type that incodes the property that one list is a non-contiguous sublist of another:
</p>
<textarea id="coq-code11">
Inductive nc_sublist : list -> list -> Prop :=
| ns_nil : nc_sublist [] []
| ns_cons₁ ls₁ ls₂ n : nc_sublist ls₁ ls₂ -> nc_sublist ls₁ (n::ls₂)
| ns_cons₂ ls₁ ls₂ n : nc_sublist ls₁ ls₂ -> nc_sublist (n::ls₁) (n::ls₂).</textarea>
<p>
Here, <code>nc_siblist ls₁ ls₂</code> means that <code>ls₁</code> is a non-contiguous sublist of
<code>ls₂</code>. We might now try to prove the proposition <code>nc_sublist (9::3::[]) (4::7::9::3::[])</code>.
Altough this is clearly true, manually choosing the right constructors of <code>nc_sublist</code> to prove this
is not entirely trivial. Instead, we can write a tactic that automates this for us. The following tactic will
repeatedly try to use the constructors <code>ns_cons₁</code> and <code>ns_cons₂</code> until it can finish
the proof with <code>ns_nil</code>, backtracking if it reaches a dead-end.
</p>
<textarea id="coq-code12">
Ltac solve_nc_sublist := solve [match goal with
| |- nc_sublist [] [] => apply ns_nil
| |- nc_sublist (_::_) [] => fail
| |- nc_sublist _ _ =>
       (apply ns_cons₁ + apply ns_cons₂); solve_nc_sublist
| |- _ => solve [auto]
end].</textarea>
<p>
    Now, we can easily prove our proposition with this custom tactic:
</p>
<textarea id="coq-code13">
Lemma ex1 : nc_sublist (9::3::[]) (4::7::9::3::[]).
solve_nc_sublist.
Qed.</textarea>
<p>
    As with other tactics, Tactician has immediately learned about <code>solve_nc_sublist</code>.
    Before we ask Tactician to use it, we will first teach it about using the lemma <code>concate_nil_r</code>
    to rewrite a goal:
</p>
<textarea id="coq-code14">
Lemma ex2 ls : 1::2::ls ++ [] = 1::2::ls.
rewrite concat_nil_r. reflexivity.
Qed.</textarea>
<p>
    We will now ask Tactician to use the things it learned from these two examples to prove a more
    complicated lemma (although this is still a toy example).
</p>
<textarea id="coq-code15">
Lemma dec2 ls₁ ls₂: nc_sublist ls₁ ls₂ ->
  nc_sublist (7::9::13::ls₁) (8::5::7::[] ++ 9::13::ls₂ ++ []).
search.
Qed.</textarea>
